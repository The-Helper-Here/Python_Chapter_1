COMMENTS IN PYTHON.

What are comments in Python?
                            Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to
execute. Comments can be written to mark author name, date when the program is written, adding notes 
for your future self, etc.
There are two types of Comments in Python:
1.Single Line Comment: Single Line comments are the comments which are written in a single line, i.e.,
                       they occupy the space of a single line.They start with a hash/pound(#).
Example:'''
#This is a single line comment.
'''
2.Multi line Comments:  Multi-Line comments are the comments which are created by using multiple lines,
                        i.e., they occupy more than one line in a program.They are enclosed in Triple quotation.
Example:'''

'''

A Mutli Line
